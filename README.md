# IoT-Assignment2

This project aims to simulate two environment IoT stations and send virtual sensor data to Azure IoT Hub with built-in mqtt. 

To make this work, you should create an IoT Hub project, create two new devices, and copy the primary connection strings of the devices to replace the CONNECTION_STRING in VirtualSensors001.py, and VirtualSensors002.py, respectively. Run the py files to send sensor data to the device. 

You can use the Azure IoT Explorer to check the data received.

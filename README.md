# IoT-Assignment2

This project aims to send virtual sensor data to Azure IoT Hub with built-in mqtt. 

To make this work, you should create an IoT Hub project, create a new device, and copy the primary connection string of the device to replace the CONNECTION_STRING in VirtualSensors.py. Run the py file to sned sensor data to the device. 

You can use the Azure IoT Explorer to check the data received.
